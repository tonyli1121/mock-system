What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Brainstorm for the structure of ErrorLogger System.
    - Created basic frame for the ErrorLogger class.
    - Created a basic frame for the documentation file for ErrorLogger System.
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Continue working on ErrorLogger class and documentation.
    - Come up with all error cases and write it into the documentation.
    - Understand the collaboration and access to other classes such as Directory and FileSystem.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need FileSystem and JShell to access the current Directory and File to see if there is 
      Error for these.
