What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Read the requirements for the addition of the functions
    - Brainstorm algorithms for the recursive ls
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Start working on the ls -r recursive function
    - Discuss with team mates

Am I blocked on anything?
    - I need a recursive function in Directory or FileSystem to work on ls
