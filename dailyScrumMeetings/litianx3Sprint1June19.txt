What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished the Jshell driver
    - makes input avaliable
    - finished distinguish method for input
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - makes the Jshell driver fits the requirements better
    - collaborate with commands
    - start working on commands if needed

Am I blocked on anything?
    - ErrorLogger, commands
    - needs to have the errorlogger to be able to trim the directory input 
    so that some commands can work on multiple directories at the same time 
    if necessary
